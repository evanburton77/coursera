Nintendo has announced that preorders for its new Switch 2 gaming console will not begin on April 9 in the US as previously planned while the company assesses “the potential impact of tariffs” \n“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.” \nNintendo announced the Switch 2 on Wednesday, just before President Donald Trump introduced a slew of tariffs on foreign goods, which heavily target Asia, where many tech supply chains are based — including Nintendo’s. The Switch is the world’s third-bestselling console and Nintendo’s second-biggest seller."
